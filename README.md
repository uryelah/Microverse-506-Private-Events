<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

To do this course, you’ve got to have Rails and several other technologies properly installed on your computer. That will be the first task if you haven’t already.

Next comes the Jumpstart Lab Blogger Tutorial (which was assigned way back in the Web Development 101 course). The Blogger tutorial is actually more challenging than the project below, and was assigned to give you a chance to get in over your head a bit so you’d pay attention along the way :)
